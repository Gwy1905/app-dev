**Title:** Inception
*Director:* Christopher Nolan  

Description: Inception is a 2010 science fiction action film directed by Christopher Nolan. The movie follows Dom Cobb, a skilled thief who specializes in extracting secrets from people's subconscious by entering their dreams. However, he is given a unique challenge: instead of stealing an idea, he must implant oneâ€”a process known as inception.

The film explores themes of dream manipulation, reality vs. illusion, and the power of the subconscious mind. With stunning visuals and a complex, layered narrative, Inception keeps audiences questioning what is real and what is merely a dream. The cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy, and Cillian Murphy.
